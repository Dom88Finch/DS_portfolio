# [Project 1:Data Science Student Grade predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/student-grade-predictor)

* Created a mini app that predicts the studentâ€™s grade for their Final year exam.
* Used linear regression to achieve the best model achieving a 90% accuracy score
* Built a GUI for users to interact with using tinker

# Project 2: Hospital stay prediction 
Predicting duration of stay in hospital during this covid-19 pandemic to help with planning and ensuring there is enough hospital capacity to accommodate the patients.

* Used feature selection techniques to identify best feasutes to include in model
* Optimized Logistic, Random Forest using GridSearchCV to imporve model 
* model prediction score of 0.35

# Project 3: Dating website analysis 
Analysis of OKCupid dataset to find possible relationships and indicators that may help with matching individuals together.

* invlolved data cleaning and preprocessing data
* Engineered features form the text from multiple columns to improve comparison analysis between individuals
* Use NLP techniques to analyse the description column of the data


Currently researching what make coupples get attracted to one another and also working on a scoring matrix that matches individuals based on a a number of features including:
- Age, Likes and dislikes,  Ethnicity, Similar Habits, Personality traits


# Project 4: Classifying tweets 

# Project 5: Football results Classifier (ongoing)

* Source alternative Data online and  webscrape match event data.
* Analysing dataset to investigate potential relationships and create a wide range of new features.
* Review of past Literature, articles and books to identify previous methods used such as ELO Rating and Expected Goals
* Use SQL to combine and warehouse data 
* predicting football match outcomes using a range of ML models including SVC,Logistic regression, AdaBoostingClassifier, and Neural Networks.
* Combine different models to create weighted voting result that allows for a probability of outcome to be computed and also the Confidence level of prediction.
 
# Future projects

**Full stack project**
 * web/ android app that enhances your language learning ability by **immersing** you in that language.
