# [Project 1:Data Science Student Grade predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/student-grade-predictor)

* Created a mini app that predicts the studentâ€™s grade for their Final year exam.
* Used linear regression to achieve the best model achieving a 90% accuracy score
* Built a GUI for users to interact with using tinker

# [Project 2: Hospital stay prediction](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/healthcare-analysis)
Predicting duration of stay in hospital during this covid-19 pandemic to help with planning and ensuring there is enough hospital capacity to accommodate the patients.

* Used feature selection techniques to identify best feasutes to include in model
* Optimized Logistic, Random Forest using GridSearchCV to imporve model 
* model prediction score of 0.35

# Project 3: Dating website analysis 
Analysis of OKCupid dataset to find possible relationships and indicators that may help with matching individuals together.

* invlolved data cleaning and preprocessing data
* Engineered features form the text from multiple columns to improve comparison analysis between individuals
* Use NLP techniques to analyse the description column of the data


Currently researching what make coupples get attracted to one another and also working on a scoring matrix that matches individuals based on a a number of features including:
- Age, Likes and dislikes,  Ethnicity, Similar Habits, Personality traits


# [Project 4: Classifying tweets](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/python-programs) 
 Program that uses Machine learning to classify whether a tweet is viral or not. The program initially uses a **KClassifier** to classify and predict whether a tweet is viral. The program is then modified preprocessing the data frame again to find new potential feature data that would improve our prediction. 
 
 This involved cleaning the data using python packages. Choosing a minimum score with which to classify whether a tweet is viral or not. Chose the median to be the viral score minimum of 13 for a tweet to be classed as viral. Created new variables which hold Boolean values to act as training set for the machine learning model. I then trained my model to predict whether a tweet was viral. From this I did further investigation to improve my model by choosing different training feature data to improve the accuracy. I was able to improve it by 15%. )
 
## MAY-June 2021

# [Project 6:(Week 1)](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/DS_portfolio/tree/main/images/Power%20BI%20-%20Sales%20analysis)
Sales data including visualization with Power BI

* Obtain sales data from company online.
* Carry out statistical analysis of data and identify possible trends or area to divert resources
* Create Visuals that enable the user to be able to understand user information

# Project 7:(Week 2)
Climate change 

Identify an area where you can apply ML techniques to predict inneficient operational methods such as (predicting potholes on certain roads)
that would reduce impact and save money to a business and reduce emissions.

(Find Kaggle data sources or challenges and sharpen your ML techniques) 
Produce a Jupyter notebook with your results and findings along with future imporvements


# Project 8: Private Chef AI(Week 3)
NLP analysis of Food recipes with a recommendation engine/APP/Website for recipe based on your favourite foods
Analysing 1000s of food recipes online and be able to understand and classify the output taste profile for each dish.
From there, we can be able to recommend dishes back to user based on their taste preferences.

Technologies:
* Webscraping and Database storage on SQL 
* NLP basics
* Data processing, training 

create an interactive web user interface

**Learn:  Full stack development (Django/ Flask/ Node.Js /React /HTML/CSS**


# Project 9:Stock market forecast using AI (Week 4)

Source different websites for different Stock information  
- webscraping, APIs, 
- Creating a Data Management system
- Working with Big Data - Data warehousing using SQL, Hadoop.

- Use different strategies and incorperate alternative data sources to predict stock prices.
- Backtesting algorithms to ensure it picks stocks and produces a profit.


Create a Website Blog/Twitter account Bot that posts weekly predictions of stock price movements for 10 highest profitable stocks movements.

*Aim: To be able to predict 5% stock price movement each week consistently *
