# [Robotic Arm Project](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/AdvancedRobotics)
ROS is a Robotic Framework used for devoloping Robots. The video below shows how you can use ROS framework to with RViz to control a Robotic Arm. To achieve this, we first need to code up the plan for the robotic arm movement. This enables us to control the different joints of the arm and ensure the trajectory planning is stable.

# In-play – Tennis Prediction project

Tennis is a popular sport that’s played across the world. The web application below shows an example of how we can predict in-play match outcomes by using Ensemble Machine Learning models. The apps enables for prediction of `set winner` or `game winner` by leveraging historical event data of major tennis tornaments such as `Wimbledon`.  App is build using python libraries such as streamlit, Data Science Stack, HTML, CSS.

# Project X :Alpha signal generation for equity & crypto-currency markets using AI

*Aim: To be able to produce entry and exit signals for multiple assets across multiple markets with an expected return of  6-9% weekly return. This is then implemented across a fully automated risk management system that is dynamically adjusted using reinforcement learning algrorithms.  *

Learning objectives and software
  - Finance basics - Fundamental analysis, Technical Analysis 
  - Best investments strategies (short and long term)
  - Trader Psychology
  - Systematic trading 
  - Risk management systems

# [Project 2: Hospital stay prediction](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/healthcare-analysis)
Predicting duration of stay in hospital during this covid-19 pandemic to help with planning and ensuring there is enough hospital capacity to accommodate the patients.

* Used feature selection techniques to identify best feasutes to include in model
* Optimized Logistic, Random Forest using GridSearchCV to imporve model 
* model prediction score of 0.35

# [Project 3: Dating website analysis](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/Dating-Analysis)
Analysis of OKCupid dataset to find possible relationships and indicators that may help with matching individuals together.

* invlolved data cleaning and preprocessing data
* Engineered features form the text from multiple columns to improve comparison analysis between individuals
* Use NLP techniques to analyse the description column of the data


Currently researching what make coupples get attracted to one another and also working on a scoring matrix that matches individuals based on a a number of features including:
- Age, Likes and dislikes,  Ethnicity, Similar Habits, Personality traits


# [Project 4: Classifying tweets](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/python-programs) 
 Program that uses Machine learning to classify whether a tweet is viral or not. The program initially uses a **KClassifier** to classify and predict whether a tweet is viral. The program is then modified preprocessing the data frame again to find new potential feature data that would improve our prediction. 
 
 This involved cleaning the data using python packages. Choosing a minimum score with which to classify whether a tweet is viral or not. Chose the median to be the viral score minimum of 13 for a tweet to be classed as viral. Created new variables which hold Boolean values to act as training set for the machine learning model. I then trained my model to predict whether a tweet was viral. From this I did further investigation to improve my model by choosing different training feature data to improve the accuracy. I was able to improve it by 15%. )
