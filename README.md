# [Project 1:Data Science Student Grade predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/student-grade-predictor)

* Created a mini app that predicts the studentâ€™s grade for their Final year exam.
* Used linear regression to achieve the best model achieving a 90% accuracy score
* Built a GUI for users to interact with using tinker

# Project 2: Hospital stay prediction 
Predicting duration of stay in hospital during this covid-19 pandemic to help with planning and ensuring there is enough hospital capacity to accommodate the patients.

* Used feature selection techniques to identify best feasutes to include in model
* Optimized Logistic, Random Forest using GridSearchCV to imporve model 
* model prediction score of 0.35

# Project 3: Dating website analysis 
Analysis of OKCupid dataset to find possible relationships and indicators that may help with matching individuals together.

* invlolved data cleaning and preprocessing data
* Engineered features form the text from multiple columns to improve comparison analysis between individuals
* Use NLP techniques to analyse the description column of the data


Currently researching what make coupples get attracted to one another and also working on a scoring matrix that matches individuals based on a a number of features including:
- Age, Likes and dislikes,  Ethnicity, Similar Habits, Personality traits


# [Project 4: Classifying tweets](https://github.com/Dom88Finch/python-programs) 
 Program that uses Machine learning to classify whether a tweet is viral or not. The program initially uses a **KClassifier** to classify and predict whether a tweet is viral. The program is then modified preprocessing the data frame again to find new potential feature data that would improve our prediction. 
 
 This involved cleaning the data using python packages. Choosing a minimum score with which to classify whether a tweet is viral or not. Chose the median to be the viral score minimum of 13 for a tweet to be classed as viral. Created new variables which hold Boolean values to act as training set for the machine learning model. I then trained my model to predict whether a tweet was viral. From this I did further investigation to improve my model by choosing different training feature data to improve the accuracy. I was able to improve it by 15%. )
 
# Project 5: Football results Classifier (ongoing)

* Source alternative Data online and  webscrape match event data.
* Analysing dataset to investigate potential relationships and create a wide range of new features.
* Review of past Literature, articles and books to identify previous methods used such as ELO Rating and Expected Goals
* Use SQL to combine and warehouse data 
* predicting football match outcomes using a range of ML models including SVC,Logistic regression, AdaBoostingClassifier, and Neural Networks.
* Combine different models to create weighted voting result that allows for a probability of outcome to be computed and also the Confidence level of prediction.
 
# Future projects

**Full stack project**
 * web/ android app that enhances your language learning ability by **immersing** you in that language.
